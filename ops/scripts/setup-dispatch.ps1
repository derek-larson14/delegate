#Requires -Version 5.1
# Setup Dispatch Pipeline (Windows)
# Run from your workspace, or pass the workspace path as an argument.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Installs rclone (via winget or direct download)
# 2. Connects your Google Drive
# 3. Downloads the transcription script
# 4. Schedules transcription every hour via Task Scheduler
#
# After setup, recordings from Dispatch on your phone are
# automatically pulled and transcripts appended to voice.md.
#
# NOTE: Windows uses companion .md transcripts (from Apps Script or
# Dispatch on-device transcription). No local 'hear' tool needed.
# Set up Apps Script transcription at delegatewithclaude.com/voice
