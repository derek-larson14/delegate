# Meeting Notes

The `/meeting` command searches this folder.

**Three ways to populate it:**

1. **Granola Sync** - If you use [Granola](https://granola.ai), install the [Granola Sync plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=granola) for Obsidian to sync notes here automatically

2. **Copy-paste** - Export notes from Otter, Notion, or wherever and drop them here as markdown

3. **Create manually** - Make new .md files using example-meeting.md as a template
