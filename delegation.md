# Delegation

Claude's task queue. Add items here, then run `/delegate` to process them.

This is the stuff you want Claude to take on — research, code, file organization, data analysis, prototyping, setup. Anything that doesn't require your voice, your relationships, or your judgment call.

When Claude completes a task, it marks it `[x]` with a note about what was done.
