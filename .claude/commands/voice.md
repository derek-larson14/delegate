# Voice Notes Processor

Read voice notes from `/voice.md` and route them to the right places.

## Processing Flow

### 1. Build context first

Before routing anything, understand the workspace:
- `tasks.md` — current tasks
- `delegation.md` — Claude's task queue
- `roadmap.md` — current priorities
- Skim recent entries in `archive/voice-archive.md` for routing patterns
- Scan project folders for existing files to route to

The more context you have, the better you route.

### 2. Read voice.md

If empty or only whitespace, stop. Nothing to do.

If there's a `## Needs context` section at the top, those entries are waiting for clarification. If you can ask the user (AskUserQuestion is available), handle them. If you can't ask (running headless), skip them — only process entries below that section.

### 3. Parse entries

Entries may be separated by `## Vault -`, `## Memo -`, or `## Dispatch -` headers (from transcription scripts), `---` or `--` separators, or just dates/timestamps. Not all sources use headers — Apple Shortcuts and manual input may just have dates and text. Parse whatever format you find. A single entry often contains multiple distinct ideas — extract them all. Text is dictated — interpret intent, not literal words.

### 4. Classify and route each idea

**User's task** (decisions, outreach, messaging, strategy, writing first drafts) → `tasks.md`
- Format: `- [ ] [task description]`
- Put under the right category header if one fits
- These are things only the user can do: relationship stuff, publishing in their voice, strategy decisions

**Claude's task** (research, code, data analysis, file organization, building, anything actionable that Claude could do) → `delegation.md`
- Format: `- [ ] [task description]` under the relevant Queue section
- Bias toward delegation.md for anything actionable — if Claude could research it, build it, analyze it, or set it up, it goes here
- NOT drafting/writing — user takes the first stab at content

**Idea for a project** → Append to the right file in a project folder
- Route to the most relevant existing file you found in step 1
- Don't create new files
- This is for pure ideas/inspiration/angles — NOT for actionable work items. If it's something that could be acted on, it goes to delegation.md or tasks.md instead

**Ambiguous** → If you can ask the user, ask. If running headless, leave in voice.md under a `## Needs context` section at the top. Below each entry, add potentially relevant files: `> See: relevant/file.md`

### 5. Archive routed entries

Append successfully routed entries (verbatim) to `archive/voice-archive.md` with:
- Processing timestamp
- Where each idea was routed
- Do NOT archive unclear entries — they stay in voice.md

### 6. Rewrite voice.md

- If there are unclear entries, voice.md should contain ONLY the `## Needs context` section at the top
- If everything was routed, empty the file

### 7. Report what was done

List each entry and what action was taken. Flag anything that needs follow-up.

## Constraints

- **Preserve voice** — Clean up transcription errors but keep the user's words. No AI summaries.
- **Append-only** — Only append to existing files. Don't modify existing content.
- **No new files** — Route to existing files only.
- **Capture everything** — Extract every sub-idea from each entry.
- **Go deep before routing** — Read more files if you're unsure where something goes.

## File Structure (scan before routing)

**Root files:**
- `tasks.md` — user's tasks (decisions, outreach, personal)
- `delegation.md` — Claude's task queue (research, code, data processing, building)
- `maybe.md` — someday ideas
- `roadmap.md` — timeline/milestones

**Project folders:** Scan for existing files that match the topic of each voice note.
