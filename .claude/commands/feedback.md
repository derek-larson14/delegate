description: Multi-perspective feedback using referance library
---

I want feedback on my work from multiple angles.

First, scan `/referance/` and read the file names. Based on what I'm working on, decide which ones are relevant. When in doubt, include it - better to have more perspectives than miss something useful.

Spin up a subagent for each relevant referance file. Each one reads their referance file, then reviews my target file. Ask each: what works, what doesn't, what's missing, what should be explored further.

After all agents return: read through their responses, where do they agree, where do they disagree? If everyone flags something as strong or weak, that's a signal. The tensions are interesting too - note where different perspectives conflict.

When possible, quote specific parts vs generalizing.

Don't make changes directly. Just give me the feedback.
