Thinking about that conversation with Marcus. He made a good point about how the onboarding is too long. People drop off. Maybe we front-load ? Give them a quick win in the first 5 minutes then do the setup stuff. Could add to the product ideas doc. also want to ask a few more people for testimonials, and remind Jake about the event on Saturday.

Had a thought about the pricing - what if we did a pay what you want tier? Feels risky but also might build goodwill. Or maybe thats naive idk. Also need to look into whether venmo works for international payments or if we need something else. stripe probably.
