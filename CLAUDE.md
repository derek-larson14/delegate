## Delegation

`delegation.md` is Claude's task queue. You add items there, then run `/delegate` to process them. Claude proposes what to take on, confirms with you, then executes.

**Split of work:**
- **Claude handles:** Research, code/scripts, data analysis, file organization, setup, prototyping, summarization, refactoring, exploration
- **You handle:** Decisions, relationship DMs, outreach, pricing, strategy, writing first drafts — anything that needs your voice or judgment

When Claude finishes a task, it marks the item `[x]` with a note about what was done. Over time this becomes a log of what Claude has shipped for you.

## Style

- Be direct
- Skip the fluff
